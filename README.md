# ABAQUS-SCRIPT

# I am writing this file in a sleeping afternoon
# 2019-04-17

# My senior fellow  apprentice had wrote a large amount of  perfect code
# But those code just sleep in their old harddisk since they graduated from BJUT
# And now i want to change all of those things
# I wish all my junior fellow can use thos code until FEM & ABAQUS replaced by some new method
